# dark-kitchen-project

We're trainees from BeCode and we started this repository on December 6th 2022. We have to create a website for a restaurant (or food shop) that only does deliveries or orders. For this, we used CSS, SASS, JavaScript and HTML. 

The website will allow customers to select the goods they want to see and add them to cart, knowing what they ordered and how much it was.
