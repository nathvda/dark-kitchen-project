# dark-kitchen-project

We're trainees from BeCode and we started this repository on December 6th 2022. We have to create a website for a restaurant (or food shop) that only does deliveries or orders. For this, we used CSS, SASS, JavaScript and HTML. 

The team working on the project is a team of four trainees trying to consolidate their understanding of web developpement : Edouard, Milo, Nathalie and Virginie.

The website will allow customers to select the goods they want to see and add them to cart, knowing what they ordered and how much it was.

We decided to use a Pastry shop example and to improve it until the deadline of the project.

Changes were made to the css and scripts. 
- Removing an item from the cart now resets the number of items in the menu cards too.
- The cart icon now changes according to whether Dark or Light Mode is used.
- Dark mode color scheme has been changed for more relaxing tones.

The first functional version of the page was finished and merged with main. This version includes:

- An add to cart functionality
- Sum of the cart functionality
- Dark mode functionality
